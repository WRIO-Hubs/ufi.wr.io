Demo <sup>[WRIO](https://wr.io) Hub</sup>

This is a demo of a new kind of website based on the machine-readable (semantic) data protocol. In Web 3.0 these websites are called hubs, as they connect pages from different sources.
You can create your own hub with any text editor or by using one of the first Web 3.0 apps: [a WYSIWYG page builder](https://core.wrioos.com/create).
